# Requirements
----------
* the power cord is plugged in only after you fix the cape.
* if you spill any liquid on the heater cover, immediately turn off the device.
* if you leave the car, do not leave the device turned on.
* you can not wash the capes, iron, maximum-shake.
* Use dry bags to store the heater.

If you follow all the above tips, then you will choose for yourself a model that will serve you for decades.
#  High level Requirements 
* Wire is like a regular hot plate. Such devices are less resistant to constant loads, differ in not long service life. But the advantage is their low price.
* Carbon fiber is notable for its rapid heating, flexibility and suitable for frequent use with high loads.

# Low level Requirements
----
* material quality.
* presence of heating along the entire length of the structure.
* system warm-up time.
* a way to fix the cape.

In order to save, drivers often choose models with minimal performance. But do not neglect the high power and the presence of a temperature sensor.

# 4W's and 1'H
--------
# 1. What is all about?
Heat Factory's Seater Heater is a heated seat cushion perfect for sitting in tree stands or on cold stadium seats. The cushion features a water resistant bottom and two pockets for Heat Factory's Large Warmers. The Seater Heater has a belt clip for easy carrying.

# 2. Where it is used?
In the car seats.

# 3. When it is needed?
Heated seats can make cars much more comfortable in the winter, or for those who often get cold even in the summer. The heater in most vehicles work well, but the car's seat warmer is close to your body allowing you to warm up faster. In some cases, the seat warms up before the rest of the vehicle does.

# 4. Why are you making it?
A heated seat allows a driver to remove their bulky overcoat giving them improved arm and leg flexibility with a concomitant improvement in driving control. Similarly, being warmly nestled in a heated seat allows the driver to focus on his driving instead of his discomfort in a cold seat.

# 5. How are you making it? / How feature implemented in it?
Heated seats are powered by a heating element, a long strip of material that functions as a resistor. A resistor resists the flow of electricity. When electric current flows through it, the energy is turned into heat, which flows through the seat, warming the rider.
